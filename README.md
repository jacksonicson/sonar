Sonar
=====

Sonar is a bundle of tools which was created to control cloud computing test beds in research environments. It consists of two components: 

1. Monitoring: An efficient monitoring solution which stores all data in an HBase database. 
2. Relay: A leightweight tool which supports the implementation of a software-reconfiguration process for cloud test bed environments.

We'll release a documentation of Sonar and Relay soon.
